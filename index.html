    <h1>Title Goes here!</h1>
    <p>
        My childhood story isn't one for the books.
        There isn't much to tell about it. For one,
        the most interesting part of my childhood would
        be that I graduated kinder as a valedictorian.
        It was great, and I did a whole speech in front
        of so many people, but it wasn't as remarkable as 
        people may think. I was kinder, after all, and
        what I achieved then is incomparable with the
        achievements of other people in the levels that
        actually matter, such as right now in college.
        I was just a quiet kid then. I didn't have so much
        friends growing up, and those few friends I had 
        are so distant now. I didn't have that "iPad kid" 
        era during my childhood, due to the fact that I 
        didn't have access to gadgets early in life. I had my
        first tablet at around 8 or 9, and even then I had
        restrictions, which did help to avoid the addiction
        towards gadgets during that time. I studied at a 
        catholic school, which meant constant prayers before
        each class, and having to go through monthly masses
        and angelus every noon. Back then, I wasn't allowed
        to have my own money, and had to bring lunch
        everyday to school, which did make me jealous of
        my classmates who could buy at the canteen. I
        did eventually get the freedom to buy using my
        own allowance, sometime around Grade 5 onwards. 
        I wasn't fond of pop culture, mainly due to not
        having access to the internet and not being exposed
        to current trends. Until now I'm still not a fan
        of the latest... everything. I remember vividly that
        I auditioned for the school church choir and when
        asked to sing anything I didn't know any popular songs
        so I had to sing a church song, which isn't bad 
        considering I was auditioning for a church choir, but
        in that moment I felt a bit ashamed for not knowing
        what others could easily sing at that moment. Looking
        back, it's easy to understand why I wasn't the most
        social as a kid. I wasn't able to keep up with 
        others, and that led to them not being fond of me. 
        It's mainly the reason why I was quiet and didn't 
        have much of that "exciting" and "fun" childhood
        everyone brags of.
